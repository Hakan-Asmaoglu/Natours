# NATOURS

Natours is a responsive website that was created as part of the online course; Advance CSS and Sass by Jonas Schmedtmann.

The main purpose was to create a professional website for a nature tour service company. The main constraint was to ensure maintainable code and folder structure by combining the BEM system with SCSS.

The main learning target was to master advanced CSS animations and layout with floats.
